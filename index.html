                <p>iconic names come from all over the world, n Ghana, the most common names throughout the different tribes centre either on the day a child was born or using tribal names that are more unique in flavour. Here are some of the many beautiful Ghanian names for males and females, names that can be used no matter the gender, and their English translations.
                    There are over 100 ethnic groups living in Ghana. The largest are Akan, Moshi-Dagbani, Ewe, and Ga. The Ashanti tribe of the Akan are the largest tribe and one of the few societies in West Africa where lineage is traced through the mother and maternal ancestors. Once famous for the luxury and wealth of their rulers, they are now more well known for their craft-work such as hand-carved stools, fertility dolls, and ‘kente’ cloth. Kente cloth is made cotton and is woven in bright, narrow strips with complex patterns.
                    so here we are going to give an akan name  hope you enjoy.
